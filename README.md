# Archetype: Template for archetypes

This repository is the template for creating archetypes.

## What is an archetype
<!--- Leave this as is for all archetypes -->

Our platform services are build on a couple of components. The lowest level of these are what we call archetypes, which is a Terraform root module with a defined deployment. These archetypes has to be flexible, but still flexible enough to support any use-cases we would encounter with our managed services.
